Language Transformer
This project implements the Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need", is a fundamental deep learning model for NLP and other sequence-based tasks.

Features
Implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch

Self-attention mechanism and multi-head attention

Positional encodings

Encoder and decoder structure

Training pipeline with sample dataset

Visualization of the architecture
